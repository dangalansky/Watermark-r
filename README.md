# Watermark'R

A desktop application that adds a pre-existing watermark to a photo and saves as a new file under the name of your choosing. 
This was coded using the Tkinter library.
I thought it easiest to paste the watermark at position (0,0) but this can be changed. I put a comment in the code where this occurs. 
Both .jpeg and .png files are suppported but as it stands, the final file is saved as a .png file.
The file will be saved inside the Watermark'r directory. 
The GUI design was done by myself in Adobe Illustrator.
As always, feel free to steal or destroy at will.
